                </h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Ashley Gills and I'm a versatile tech professional with QA experience. 
                    I enjoy utilizing my passion for technology to meet and exceed business needs 
                    and expectations. I recently completed my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification and 
                    I am a graduate of Tech Elevator's Java Web Applications Bootcamp. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am working to expand into the cloud and generative AI tech spaces while I maneuver through my 
                    tech journey.

                    <h4>A Little Something About Me</h4>
                    <p>
                        Having earned a BA in Literature and then later earning a BS in Psychology, 
                        I am more than familiar with shifting gears. In the April 2022, enrolled in 
                        Tech Elevator's Java Web Application program. I set my career change in 
                        further motion in October 2022 when I accepted a QA Analyst Internship with 
                        Whiskerâ€™s IT team. Most recently, in September 2023, I became certified as an AWS Cloud Practitioner!
                        <br /><br />
                        Now that I have graduated from Tech Elevator, my goal is to take on an 
                        entry-level software engineer while I develop my skills in cloud and generative AI.

                            <h4>Harnessing Generative AI as a Learning Tool for Adults with ADHD</h4>
                            <p>
                                Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often face unique challenges 
                                when it comes to learning. Traditional educational tools can sometimes fall short in 
                                holding their interest and catering to their learning style. However, the rise of generative 
                                AI promises a new horizon for adult learners with ADHD by offering personalized and engaging 
                                educational experiences.

                                The digital landscape is ever-evolving, with new technologies continuously reshaping the 
                                way we interact with the world around us. Two such technological marvelsâ€”cloud computing 
                                and generative AIâ€”have exploded in recent years, each marking their territory as cornerstones 
                                of modern innovation. Cloud computing, with its sprawling infrastructure, has democratized 
                                access to powerful computational resources, making them available to anyone with an internet 
                                connection. Meanwhile, generative AI has emerged from the realm of speculative fiction to 
                                become a tangible force, driving creativity and generating solutions that were previously 
                                the sole domain of human ingenuity.

                            <p>
                                There is definitely a big boom around Generative AI recently and 
                                I'm sure we can all see why. Tools like ChatGPT have become 
                                remarkable resources across fields. I am particular drawn to 
                                this type of tech for what it can offer as learning tools. 
                                One of the things I love about technology is the support it can
                                provide us as we tackle learning new information or develop our skills.

                            <h4>Getting My First Tech Certification</h4>
                            <p>
                                It feels unreal to change careers especially when
                                transitioning into an entirely different field. I know everyone talks 
                                about the imposter syndrome you feel and it is such a difficult 
                                feeling to get past. Recently I poured my time and energy in obtaining my 
                                first AWS Certification as a Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner. 
                                When I passed the certification exam it felt like a huge weight was 
                                lifted and a sign that I was really capable of breaking into tech. 
                                The imposter syndrome is still ever present but I can see it subsiding.

                            <p>
                                In my experience, one of the hardest things to do when trying to break 
                                into tech is picking what to begin with, where to start, how to start, 
                                and so on. The options in tech seem so endless and ever growing. 
                                Cybersecurity. Quality assurance. Data analysis. Software development. 
                                Mobile development. Cloud infrastructure. Generative AI. 
                                The list goes on and on. It feels impossible to choose but once you do, 
                                what's next? Where do I start? How do I start? There is no one-size fits 
                                all entryway into this field. The number of choices can be overwhelming 
                                and I certainly felt this way. What is so wonderful about technology is 
                                that it's wide open and that's also why it can be so difficult figure 
                                out your place in it.
